            <h2 class="timber distribution">sizes to be distributed</h2>
            <p>Timber product are distributed in different sizes either from the shop directly or be delivered to the site.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Timber products are very essential. <strong>the tools for home construction</strong> of timber gives strong structures and designs to beautifying our homes both in and out.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h2>wall plating</h2>
            <p>wall plating is one among the big sizes used to for concret buildings, it gives the building a very strong and balanced shape. they are directly attatched to the blocks in the last caoch of every house, all raphters are placed on wall plating to give a balance before the roofing process.</p>
            <h3>2` by 6 as a wall plate</h3>
            <p>2 by 6 of any length is more flate than the 3 by 4, it is mostly used on building that has wider blocks e.g 7inch or 9inch blocks.</p>
            <pre><code>Example 3 by 4 by 12 or by 18</code></pre>
            <p>the lengyh of wall plate is either by 12ft or by 18ft depending on the demand. although working with both is thesame but consume more wood in using 12ft than in 18ft.</p>
            <h3>3 by 4 as a wall plate</h3>
            <p>3inch by 4inch by 12ft or by 18ft is actually thicker than than the 2inch by 6inch by 12ft or by 18ft, this is use for blocks that are either 5inches or 6inches, but also give a higher length to the hieght of the building. wall plate in this sizes are the first wood work to be taken in doing wood work in any building process. wall plate are best in wood from the following species.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the wood specie called small leave in layman understanding.</li>
              <li>the specie called mahoghani.</li>
              <li>Red kang wood is another good specie.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>while the following species seems to be the alternative one as the case may be depending on the demand and the person handling the contract.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>the specie called Antiaries .</li>
              <li>another specie that can be used in place of the above is the specie called <i>bush pear</i>by discription.</li>
              <li>Another specie is the one called <i>Agbar</i>.</li>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">wood scantries</h2>
            <p>scantries as a terminology used in wood processing and supply, describes the dimensions of wood as suitable for use in building.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Scantries can be of difference categories such as. <strong>Raphters i.e 2 by 4 by 12, pollines i.e 2 by 3 by 12, noggines i.e 2 by 2 by 12 etc.</strong> Other dimensions can be 1 by 2 by 12, 1 by 1 by 12 and battons for decorating a building.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Wood supplied in scantries of, <em>raphters, pollines and noggines</em>euismod. are of difference dimensions to give the capenters what is desired to give a balance in the building structure, they are used according to their dimensions, from biggest size to the smallest, i.e after the placing of the wall plates followed by the king post, the raphters, the pollines and the noggines respectively.</p>
            <p>Others like the 1 by 1, 1 by 2 and battons are used inside the building after the ceilling baord have been suspended, the battons will hold them tight as well as giving it a nice look. some of these scantries from Obudu shop are shown in the figure below</p><br>
